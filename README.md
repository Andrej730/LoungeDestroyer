## Instructions
Instructions how to install on Chrome

1. Download [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
2. [Install script from here](http://ncla.me/csgl3000/csgl3000.user.js)

Instructions how to install on Firefox

1. Download [Greasemonkey add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and install it
2. [Install script from here](http://ncla.me/csgl3000/csgl3000.user.js)

The script is not the most user friendliest at the moment, so to get some feedback from the script you need to have your browser console opened.

To open console for Chrome, hit F12 (developers mode) and select Console tab.

To open console for Firefox, hit F12 (developers mode) and select Console tab. To filter log messages only, toggle on "JS" and "Logging" buttons, like shown in image below:

## Updates
It is possible that CSGOLounge.com might update their site which breaks LoungeDestroyer's functionality. GreaseMonkey and Tampermonkey provides auto-updating functionality.

**On TamperMonkey (Chrome):** go to your TamperMonkey dashboard, manage to Settings, locate "Script update" section and there should be "Check interval" select menu. You can change it to "Every hour" if you so desire. To force update, go to Dashboard => Installed userscripts, select/tick "CS:GO Lounge Destroyer", and select "Trigger an update" from the menu and press "Start".

**On GreaseMonkey (Firefox):** GreaseMonkey doesn't have an option for update intervals in their options. You can force a manual update however. Go to your Add-ons => User Scripts, right click on "CS:GO Lounge Destroyer" and click "Find updates" or "Forced Find updates". If both options are disabled, you need to disable "Require secure updates" in GreaseMonkey options and try again.
